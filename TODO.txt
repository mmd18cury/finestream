-  add saving stream in array/pack, prepared to be sent, and than add move semantics for this pack
-  add saving stream in another representable view: some analog or extension of vector <bool> / bitset to store in bits, but show in chars '1' or '0'
-  add explicit check that FILE_STREAM is .good otherwise throw an error, if for example cannot read/write from it
-  add seekg, seekp, tellg, tellp in two variants each - int for bit number and pair <int, int> for (byte, bit)
-  accelerate >> bitset<N>, like << bitset<N> disposing of GetByte() for middle bytes
-  add welcome topics to Discussions
-  add new parameteres to finestream constructor(), including, for example, bool for saving info of lengths, and
info about where to output - file, array/vector, package etc.
-  add a method for counting 1s in bytes 
-  work out what to do with BRLAST_BYTE when you use seekg/seekp
